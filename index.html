    <h2>A little bit about me...</h2>
    
    <p>I am currently a Junior studying Computer Science at
        Michigan State University. I am from Mason Michigan and admire 
        the nature the Michigan has to offer. During my free time, you can find
        me on a tennis court playing tennis or glued to my switch playing
        animal crossing. I love learning new skills and crafts I can do on my 
        free time also. Some of my hobbies are baking, knitting, and finishing
        sudoku puzzles!

    <h2>How I got into Computer Science</h2>
    <p>I was first introduced the summer before college started. Originally
        I was going into school as a environmental engineering major but was
        introduced to CSE in a google summer camp for women engineers. 
        I soon switched my major over to computer science. Once I figured it
        was like one big puzzle to solve (and I do love a good puzzle.) I became 
        more and more interested in become a programmer.
