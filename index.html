    <h1> Hi there, my name is Gigi!</h1>

    <h2>A little bit about me...</h2>
    
    <p>I am currently a Junior studying Computer Science at
        Michigan State University. I am from Mason Michigan and admire 
        the nature the Michigan has to offer. During my free time, you can find
        me on a tennis court playing tennis or glued to my switch playing
        animal crossing. I love learning new skills and crafts I can do on my 
        free time also. Some of my hobbies are baking, knitting, and finishing
        sudoku puzzles!
    </p>    
    <h2>How I got into Computer Science</h2>
    <p>I was first introduced the summer before college started. Originally
        I was going into school as a environmental engineering major but was
        introduced to CSE in a google summer camp for women engineers. 
        I soon switched my major over to computer science. Once I figured it
        was like one big puzzle to solve (and I do love a good puzzle.) I became 
        more and more interested in become a programmer.
    </p>
    <h2>My experience in the CSE world!</h2>
    <p>I am always eager to learn new things, especially when it involves coding, 
        In the summer of 2019, I was a lead TA in a pilot program at Michigan State
        University that lead incoming freshman(women) into an introductory to coding course 
        through the College of Engineering. I am also a teaching assistant for an intro 
        to python class at MSU as well. I absolutely love teaching students python. I know 
        exactly how daunting coding can feel to some, mostly because I felt the same
        way when I first started and often still do because there are <strong>SO</strong>
        many different areas of python a person could learn. I believe TA'ing really helps me
        better understand coding in a different perspective by being able to think about
        solving problems in multiple different ways. It also continues to help build my 
        understanding and knowledge of code.
